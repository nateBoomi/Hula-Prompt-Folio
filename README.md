# ðŸŒ´ðŸ“– Hula's Prompt Folio
A living toolbox of practical LLM prompts for solving real-world problems.

This folio contains the battle-tested prompts and methodologies I rely on daily.  While these tools are tailored for my workflow, they are shared openly with the hope that they can spark inspiration and become a valuable part of yours.
